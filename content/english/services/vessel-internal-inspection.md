A skid mounted 3000psi working pressure (WP) Portable Sand Separator can accommodate 10 liters of sand accumulation per hour in the sand pocket without restricting the flow and ensures uninterrupted production measurement.

It houses an integral speed breaker attached to the top that efficiently break down solids through centrifugal force to settle at the bottom.
