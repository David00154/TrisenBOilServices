## Leak / Pressure Operation

> Pressure accidents are caused by a combination of factors, prevention programs are designed to decrease the risks associated with every operation. 
>
> Trisenb Oil Services refines its prevention program for leak / pressure job applications by considering the following.

-	The design pressure of a piping system is the pressure at the most severe condition of coincident internal or external pressure and temperature expected during service of which the deadhead pressure of a pump or the relief valve set pressure.

-	The design temperature of a piping system is the temperature at the most severe condition of coincident pressure expected during service.

**Pressure / leak test on production facility equipment as below.**
-	**Flow lines, spools and hoses.** 

-	**Modules and manifolds.**
-	**Christmas tree and risers.** 
-	**Valves and sub surface safety valve.**
-	**Surface and underground storage tanks.**
-   **Air tanks and acid tanks.**
-	**Ship fenders, suction and discharge hoses.**
-	**Pipe clamps**
